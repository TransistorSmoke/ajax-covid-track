# ajax-covid-track

As I continue to study the basics of Javascript, I practiced using the XMLHttpRequest object for this app. Functionalities are pretty straightforward.

This app retrieved Covid 19 data. Since I currenty live in Australia, I set it such that it retrieves data from all Australian states in the last 7 days. I used HTML, CSS/SCSS and vanilla for this practice project.

The API used is from https://covid19api.com/.
